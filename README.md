# Master Software Architecture: A Pragmatic Guide Book

Welcome, brave soul, to the digital playground of "Master Software Architecture: A Pragmatic Guide"!

## What is this all about?

This repo is like that spare room in your house where you dump stuff "just in case." I created it for the book, but who knows where it'll go? It might evolve into the next big thing in tech, or it might just sit here collecting digital dust. 

## What is actually here?

Currently, this repo is home to some lonely diagrams. They are like the early birds at a party, waiting for the book to show up and get things started.

## Feedback

Found a typo? Spotted a logic flaw? Just want to tell me my diagrams look like they were drawn by a caffeinated octopus? Feel free to open a GitHub issue! I promise I won't cry... much.

Besides, feel free to add the review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216954084-master-software-architecture)

## The Future

Will this repo become the next big thing in software architecture? Will it inspire a Hollywood blockbuster? Will it be forgotten faster than that New Year's resolution you made to floss daily? Only time will tell.

Enjoy the reading, and may your code be ever bug-free!
